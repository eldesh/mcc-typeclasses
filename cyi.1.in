.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is an interactive environment that allows evaluating and debugging
Curry goals with respect to a Curry module loaded into the
interpreter. At startup,
.Nm
reads and interprets commands from the file 
.Pa .cyirc
in the current directory if it exists, or from
.Pa .cyirc
in your home directory otherwise, and then loads either the first
module specified on the command line or the Curry prelude.
.Pp
.Ss Goals
A goal is a Curry expression optionally followed by a where-clause,
which can be used for providing local definitions for the goal.
.Pp
All entities exported from the
.Li Prelude
and the module specified in the last
.Ic :load
command are in scope with unqualified and qualified names unless they
are shadowed by one of the declarations from the where-clause.
Entities from modules that are imported directly or indirectly from
the module specified in the last
.Ic :load
command are also in scope, but only with qualified names.
.Pp
All free variables of the goal must be declared either in the
where-clause or by using a let expression as goal. The bindings of the
free variables are displayed together with the normal form of the goal
after successful evaluation unless the goal is of type
.Li IO Ar t .
.Pp
.Ss Commands
At the prompt of the interactive environment, the following commands
can be entered:
.Bl -tag -width -indent -compact
.It Ar goal
Evaluate
.Ar goal
in the context of the current module.
.It Ic :^ Op Ar goal
Evaluate
.Ar goal
in the context of the current module. If
.Ar goal
is omitted, the previous goal is evaluated again.
.It Ic :debug Op Ar goal
Invoke the debugger for
.Ar goal .
It may take some time to recompile the source modules with debugging
information.
If
.Ar goal
is omitted, the debugger is invoked for the previous goal.
.It Ic :type Op Ar goal
Print the type of
.Ar goal
instead of evaluating it. If
.Ar goal
is omitted, the type of the previous goal is shown.
.It Ic :load Ar module
Set the current evaluation context to
.Ar module .
This command will compile
.Ar module
and all modules it depends on. The module can be specified either by
the name of its source file (ending in
.Pa .lcurry
or
.Pa .curry )
or a plain module name.
.Nm
displays the name of the current module in its prompt.
.It Ic :load
Reset the current evaluation context to the Curry prelude.
.It Ic :reload
Repeat the last load command.
.It Ic :freshen
Recompile the current module and all imported source files.
.It Ic :clean
Remove all compiled files for the current module and all imported
source files.
.It Ic :edit Ar file
Invoke the editor for
.Ar file .
The default editor is
.Pa /usr/bin/vi ,
but this can be changed by setting one of the environment variables
.Ev VISUAL
and
.Ev EDITOR
to your preferred editor before starting
.Nm .
.It Ic :edit
Edit the source file of the current module.
.It Ic :set Ar option No ...
Add
.Ar option Ns No s
to the list of compiler options.
.It Ic :unset Ar word No ...
Remove
.Ar word Ns No s
from the list of compiler options.
.It Ic :cd Ar dir
Change the current directory to
.Ar dir .
.It Ic :cd
Print the current directory.
.It Ic :! Ar command
Execute the shell command
.Ar command .
.It Ic :version
Display the compiler's version.
.It Ic :help
Show the list of supported commands.
.It Ic :quit
Quit
.Nm .
.El
All commands, except for
.Ic :cd
and
.Ic :clean ,
may be abbreviated to their first letter.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width -indent -compact
.It Pa .cyirc
.It Pa ~/.cyirc
Commands from these files are read and interpreted on startup. If both
files exist, only
.Pa .cyirc
is used.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.cyi_history
The command line history is stored in file
.Pa ~/.cyi_history .
.El

.Xr cyc 1 , 
.Xr cymake 1
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is implemented as a shell script which invokes
.Xr cymake 1
and
.Xr cyc 1
for compiling modules and goals. Commands are read from the standard
input using the shell's builtin
.Ic read
command. Some shells, e.g.
.Pa /bin/sh
on Solaris, cannot read raw input but apply backslash processing to
the input. When
.Nm
is executed by such a shell, all backslash characters on the
command line must be escaped by another backslash character; i.e., you
have to enter
.Li \(rs\(rsx -> x
in a goal instead of
.Li \(rsx -> x
and
.Li ord '\(rs\(rsn'
instead of
.Li ord '\(rsn' .
In order to remind you of this limitation,
.Nm
displays the following warning at startup when it is appropriate.
.Dl Warning: Backslashes on the command line must be escaped
.Dl \& \& For instance, use \(rs\(rsx -> x for a lambda abstraction
.Dl \& \& and '\(rs\(rsn' for the linefeed character.
.Pp
Command line editing and history require support from the
.Ic read
command of the shell, which executes the
.Nm
script. This is available only for Gnu Bash and Korn shells except for
the public domain version. Command line editing also works for the Z
shell, but without history.
