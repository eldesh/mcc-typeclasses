.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a
.Xr make 1
like tool for compiling Curry programs. Dependencies are automatically
extracted from the source files; there is no need to construct or
maintain a Makefile.
.Pp
.Nm
accepts options and file names on the command line in an arbitrary
order. The file arguments determine what to compile. If
.Ar target
is the name of an executable (i.e. it has no extension),
.Ar target Ns Pa .lcurry
or
.Ar target Ns Pa .curry
is assumed to contain the main module of the program. All modules it
depends on are compiled (if necessary) and linked to an executable. If
.Ar target
is the name of a source module (i.e. it ends in
.Pa .lcurry
or
.Pa .curry
or an object module (i.e. it ends in
.Pa .o )
then the object file for that module is generated. Archive files and
shared libraries (i.e. files ending with
.Pa .a ,
.Pa .so ,
.Pa .dylib ,
or
.Pa .dll )
are not targets, but passed as additional arguments to the linker.
.Pp
.Nm
allows several programs to reside in the same directory. Modules can
be shared between several programs. Directories to search for modules
can be specified with the
.Fl i
flag, in the same way as for 
.Xr cyc 1 .
In addition, directories which are searched for interfaces of library
modules can be specified with the
.Fl P
flag.
.Pp
.Nm
correctly handles the fact that the Curry compiler generates two
files, an object file and an interface file, for each module compiled.
.Pp
.Ss Options
.Nm
understands the following options:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl n
No execution mode. Print commands but do not execute them.
.It Fl ###
No execution mode. Print commands but do not execute them. Differs
from
.Fl n
in that all arguments are quoted. This allows to capture the commands
and execute them in another shell.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode. Do not print commands before executing them.
.It Fl M
Output a Makefile compatible dependency list on the standard output.
.It Fl -find
For each command line target
.Ar t ,
.Nm
will print a line of the form 
.Sm off
.Ar t Li :
.Sm on
.Ar f ,
where
.Ar f
is the name of the source or interface file corresponding to
.Ar t .
If 
.Ar t
is a module name,
.Nm
will look for the source or interface file first in the current
directory and then along the search path. If no file is found,
.Ar f
is empty. 
.It Fl a
When an executable is produced, the executable is always relinked,
even if it is not out of date with respect to its object files.
.It Fl e Ar goal
Evaluate
.Ar goal
instead of producing an executable file. If this option is combined
with
.Fl o Ar file ,
an executable is produced in
.Ar file
that evaluates
.Ar goal
instead of function
.Li main .
In that case, the executable is always relinked as with the
.Fl a
option, even if it appears to be not out of date with respect to its
object files. This option cannot be used when compiling more than one
module.
.It Fl T Ar goal
Compute the type of
.Ar goal .
The type is written to the standard output or the file specified with
a
.Fl o
option. This option cannot be used when compiling more than one
module.
.It Fl -debug
Compile the program for use with the debugger. As object files
compiled with
.Fl -debug
cannot be linked with object files compiled without
.Fl -debug ,
.Nm
uses the suffix
.Pa .d.o
instead of
.Pa .o
for object files when this option is specified.
.It Fl i Ar dir
Add directory
.Ar dir
to the list of paths used to locate imported modules. By default, the
compiler searches only the current directory for source files. Note
that the current directory is always searched first.
.Pp
The directory
.Ar dir
is also added to the list of paths used to locate C header files, as
if
.Fl I Ar dir
was present on the command line.
.It Fl P Ar dir
Add directory
.Ar dir
to the list of paths used to locate interface files for library
modules. By default, the compiler searches for interface files in its
standard library directory
.Pa @libdir@/curry-@version@ .
.Pp
The directory
.Ar dir
is also added to the lists of paths used to locate C header files and
libraries, respectively, as if
.Fl I Ar dir
and
.Fl L Ar dir
were present on the command line.
.Pp
The compiler scans the directories specified with
.Fl P
before the installation directory; thus, it is possible to hide the
interfaces of the standard library by using this option.
.It Fl o Ar file
Puts the executable file in
.Ar file .
This option cannot be used when compiling more than one module. This
option is ignored if compiling to an object file.
.It Fl -clean
Remove all compiled files for a program. If specified in conjunction
with
.Fl -debug
only the object files for the debugger, i.e. with suffix
.Pa .d.o ,
are removed.
.El
Most other flags are assumed to be compiler options and are passed to
.Nm cyc
when compiling and linking modules.
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width -indent -compact
.It Ev CURRY_PATH
The environment variable
.Ev CURRY_PATH
is used to locate the auxiliary executables used by
.Nm .
The default value is
.Pa @libdir@/curry-@version@ .
.Pp
.It Ev CURRY_IMPORT_PATH
.It Ev CURRY_INCLUDE_PATH
.It Ev CURRY_LIBRARY_PATH
The environment variables
.Ev CURRY_IMPORT_PATH ,
.Ev CURRY_INCLUDE_PATH ,
and
.Ev CURRY_LIBRARY_PATH
contain colon-separated lists of directories that are searched for
imported interfaces, included header files, and library files,
respectively. Their default value is
.Ev $CURRY_PATH .
.El                      
.Sh FILES                \" File used or created by the topic of the man page
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Pa @bindir@/cyc-@version@

.It Pa @libdir@/curry-@version@/cymk
Dependency generator for Curry programs.
.It Pa @libdir@/curry-@version@/newer
