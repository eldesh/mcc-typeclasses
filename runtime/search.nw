\subsection{Encapsulated Search}
The implementation of encapsulated search is mostly private to this
module. The external entry points into this module are the external
function [[try]], which starts a new encapsulated search, and the
function [[suspend_search]], which allows the program to temporarily
suspend an encapsulated search.

Search contexts are allocated on the stack in order to save the
machine state before an encapsulated search starts and to restore the
machine state after the encapsulated search is left again. Note that
the argument on the top of the stack is passed to the local search and
not saved by the context.

The [[try]] function starts an encapsulated search. After pushing a
new search context onto the stack and creating a new search space,
[[try]] starts the evaluation of the search goal by applying it to a
fresh variable. In addition, a queue-me node is created that allows
checking for successful termination of the goal's evaluation. %'

When [[try]] is applied to an already solved search goal (as returned
from a previous encapsulated search), this search goal is returned
immediately. In addition, when [[try]] is applied to a partially
solved search goal, the goal variable and queue-me node of that goal
are shared instead of allocating fresh nodes.

@ 
A solved search goal is represented by a (partial) application of
function [[solved_goal]] to a search continuation saving the state of
the solved goal. When such a closure is applied to an argument, this
argument is unified with a copy of the goal's solution. Copying %'
ensures that multiple applications of a (partially) solved search goal
to different arguments succeed, if the (partial) solution contains
free variables. For instance, the expression
\begin{verbatim}
  let [g] = try (\x -> success) in g 0 & g 1
\end{verbatim}
succeeds because \verb|try (\x -> success)| is equivalent to
\verb|[\x -> success]|.

@ 
A partially solved search goal is returned from an encapsulated search
when a non-deterministic computation step has to be performed. In that
case, the current state of the computation is saved in a list of
search continuation nodes. For each alternative continuation, a
(partial) application of function [[search_cont]] to the corresponding
search continuation node is created. When one of these closures is
applied to an argument, the saved state is restored and a unification
between the argument and the partial solution computed so far for the
search goal is performed. The unification is started before resuming
the evaluation of the search goal in order to allow an effective
implementation of pruning search strategies. Note that [[try]]
implicitly performs this unification when it is applied to a partially
solved search goal by sharing the goal variable.

If the current search space is a root space, i.e., if no
non-deterministic choice was performed for the current goal, the
current space will be adopted as a child by the search space of the
resumed search goal. Otherwise, the saved state must be copied into
the current search space. This policy ensures that -- except for some
unusual cases, e.g., continuing a partially solved goal in a global
context -- expensive copying is avoided.

Note that [[search_goal_proceed]] discards the value on the top of the
stack and therefore it does not matter that [[bind_var]] returns the
argument to which [[search_cont]] was applied, whereas the equality
constraint returns the constant [[Success]].

@ 
When no thread can be run in an encapsulated search, the evaluation of
the search goal either did succeed or a deadlock has occurred. Both
cases can be distinguished by examining the queue-me node allocated by
[[try]] for that purpose. If the search was successful, the queue-me
node has been overwritten with (an indirection to) [[Success]]. Thus,
if this node is not bound to [[Success]], the evaluation has stopped
due to a deadlock. In that case, the calling thread cannot be
continued, too, and is terminated instantly.

\ToDo{Instead of waiting for the deadlock to propagate up to the
  global context, report an error when a deadlock occurs.}

The function [[suspend_search]] suspends the current search and
eventually enclosing searches in order to make [[space]] a local space.
This is intended to allow evaluation of a non-local lazy application
within an encapsulated search and in order to suspend a search until a
non-local variable is instantiated. The return stack set up by
[[suspend_search]] ensures that the suspended search is resumed at
address [[retIp]] after [[node]] has been evaluated.

\label{encapsulation}
There is an inherent conflict between sharing (of logical variables
and lazy applications) and non-deterministic evaluation, as was
recently pointed out in~\cite{BrasselHanusHuch04:Encapsulating}. An
implementation of encapsulated search can either preserve sharing at
the cost of being unable to encapsulate some non-deterministic
computations (\emph{weak encapsulation}) or encapsulate all
non-deterministic computations at the cost of losing sharing of
unevaluated applications (\emph{strong encapsulation}), which can make
the result of a program depend on evaluation order. As a simple
example, consider the program
\begin{verbatim}
  coin = 0
  coin = 1
  goal | xs =:= findall (\z -> z =:= y) & x =:= y = (x,xs)
    where y = coin
          x,xs free
\end{verbatim}
With weak encapsulation, which is used by our implementation of
encapsulated search, the non-deterministic evaluation of \texttt{coin}
is not encapsulated, but \texttt{y} will have a consistent meaning in
the program. In particular, \texttt{goal} has the two
non-deterministic solutions \texttt{(0,[0])} and \texttt{(1,[1])}.
With strong encapsulation, the result of \texttt{goal} depends on the
order in which the equality constraints are evaluated. If the left
constraint is evaluated first, \texttt{goal} has solutions
\texttt{(0,[0,1])} and \texttt{(1,[0,1])}, i.e., there are two
different interpretations for \texttt{y}. On the other hand, if the
right constraint is evaluated first, \texttt{goal} has the same
solutions as with weak encapsulation, i.e., \texttt{(0,[0])} and
\texttt{(1,[1])}.

Since both approaches are unsatisfactory in some way, the authors
of~\cite{BrasselHanusHuch04:Encapsulating} propose a new primitive IO
action [[getSearchTree]] for encapsulated search, which is based on
strong encapsulation. As this primitive can be used only at the
monadic top-level of a program, problematic examples like
\texttt{goal} cannot occur.

In order to implement [[getSearchTree]], we provide a primitive IO
action [[encapsulate]] that is quite similar to [[try]], but uses a
fresh copy of its input argument within the local search space, which
is necessary in order to achieve strong encapsulation, and does not
start the evaluation of the search goal so that no error is reported
in the program
\begin{verbatim}
  main = do { getSearchTree (error "no computation"); return () }
\end{verbatim}
