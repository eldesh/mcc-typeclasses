\subsection{The Stack}
The stack of the abstract machine is used to save local variables and
the return address of a function before calling another function. In
addition, the abstract machine creates choice points and search
contexts on the stack, which are used for the implementation of
non-deterministic evaluation.

The stack is allocated in an array starting at [[stack_base]] and
ending at [[stack_end]]. The stack grows from top to bottom and
overflows when the value of the stack pointer register [[regs.sp]]
drops below [[stack_base]]. Note that [[regs.sp]] always points to the
node that was pushed last onto the stack.

<<stack.h>>=
extern Node **stack_base, **stack_end;

@
<<stack.c>>=
#include "config.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "debug.h"
#include "run.h"
#include "regs.h"
#include "heap.h"
#include "stack.h"
#include "vars.h"
#include "main.h"

Node **stack_base;
Node **stack_end;

@
The initialization function allocates a stack array with the specified
size.

<<stack.h>>=
extern void init_stack(unsigned int stack_size);

@
<<stack.c>>=
void
init_stack(unsigned int stack_size)
{
    stack_size = (stack_size + pagemask) & ~pagemask;
    stack_base = (Node **)malloc(stack_size + pagemask);
    if ( stack_base == NULL )
	sys_error("init_stack");

    stack_base = (Node **)(((long)stack_base + pagemask) & ~pagemask);
    stack_end  = stack_base + stack_size / word_size;
}

@ 
Before allocating items on the stack it should be checked that
enough space is available. The macros [[CHECK_STACK]] and
[[CHECK_STACK1]] can be used for that purpose. If a stack overflow
occurs, the program is aborted with a fatal error by calling the
function [[stack_overflow]].

<<stack.h>>=
extern void stack_overflow(void) __attribute__ ((noreturn));

#define CHECK_STACK1()	 if ( regs.sp <= stack_base ) stack_overflow();
#define CHECK_STACK(n)	 if ( regs.sp - (n) < stack_base ) stack_overflow();

@
<<stack.c>>=
void
stack_overflow()
{
    fprintf(stderr,
	    "Stack overflow; current size: %u bytes\n"
	    "Use +RTS -kSIZE to increase stack size\n",
	    stacksize);
    exit(2);
}

\subsubsection{Choice Points and Search Contexts}
Choice points are used for saving the current state of the abstract
machine at a non-deterministic split of a computation in global
backtracking search. A search context is used for saving the current
state of the abstract machine before entering an encapsulated search.
The information saved in both includes a pointer to a null-terminated
array of alternative continuations, the ready queue, the previous
choice point or search context, the current top of the trail, the
current heap pointer, the current search space, and the global
non-deterministic execution handlers (see below).

Saving the current heap pointer allows releasing all memory allocated
since the choice point or search context was created immediately upon
backtracking and when returning from a failed encapsulated search,
respectively.

A pointer to the current choice point or search context is saved in
the [[regs.bp]] register. Choice points and search contexts can be
distinguished by examining the [[btAlts]] field. It contains a null
pointer for search contexts as there are no alternative continuations.

<<stack.h>>=
#define is_search_context(cp)	((cp)->btAlts == 0)

typedef struct choicepoint {
    const Label	       *btAlts;		/* remaining alternatives */
    unsigned int       btCid;		/* id of current thread */
    Node	       **btDsBase;	/* saved thread stack base */
    struct choicepoint *btBp;		/* previous choice point */
#if !NO_STABILITY
    struct thread      *btThd;		/* saved thread pointer */
#endif
    union thread_node  *btRq;		/* saved run queue */
#if !COPY_SEARCH_SPACE
    struct save_rec    *btTp;		/* saved trail pointer */
#endif
    struct dict_node   *btDict;		/* saved dictionary tail pointer */
    word	       *btHp;		/* saved heap pointer */
    SearchSpace	       *btSpc;		/* saved search space */
    const struct nondet_handlers *btHandlers;
} Choicepoint;

@ 
The function [[push_choice_point]] creates a new choice point or
search context on the stack and saves the current state of the
abstract machine into that choice point.

<<stack.h>>=
extern void push_choice_point(const Label *);

@ 
<<stack.c>>=
void
push_choice_point(const Label *alts)
{
    Choicepoint *oldBp = regs.bp;

    /* create a new choice point on the stack */
    CHECK_STACK(wordsof(Choicepoint));
    regs.sp -= wordsof(Choicepoint);
    regs.bp  = (Choicepoint *)regs.sp;

    /* save the machine state in the choice point */
    regs.bp->btAlts	= alts;
    regs.bp->btCid	= regs.cid;
    regs.bp->btDsBase	= regs.ds_base;
    regs.bp->btBp	= oldBp;
#if !NO_STABILITY
    regs.bp->btThd	= regs.thd;
#endif
    regs.bp->btRq	= regs.rq;
#if !COPY_SEARCH_SPACE
    regs.bp->btTp	= regs.tp;
#endif
    regs.bp->btDict	= names_tail;
    regs.bp->btHp	= regs.hp;
    regs.bp->btSpc	= regs.ss;
    regs.bp->btHandlers = regs.handlers;

    /* adjust the heap limit */
    regs.hlim = regs.hp;
}

@ 
The functions [[reset_choice_point]] and [[pop_choice_point]] restore
the abstract machine state saved in a choice point or search context.
In addition, [[pop_choice_point]] also pops the choice point or search
context from the stack.

<<stack.h>>=
extern void reset_choice_point(void);
extern void pop_choice_point(void);

@ 
<<stack.c>>=
void
reset_choice_point()
{
    regs.cid     = regs.bp->btCid;
    regs.ds_base = regs.bp->btDsBase;
#if !NO_STABILITY
    regs.thd	 = regs.bp->btThd;
#endif
    regs.rq	 = regs.bp->btRq;
    regs.ss	 = regs.bp->btSpc;
    regs.sp	 = (Node **)regs.bp;
}

void
pop_choice_point()
{
    reset_choice_point();
    regs.handlers = regs.bp->btHandlers;
    regs.sp	  = (Node **)(regs.bp + 1);
    regs.bp	  = regs.bp->btBp;
    regs.hlim	  = regs.bp ? regs.bp->btHp : heap_base;
}

@
\subsubsection{Non-deterministic evaluation}
The abstract machine uses the \texttt{Choices} statement in order to
handle different non-deterministic solutions of a goal. Depending on
the context, this statement is handled differently. In global search
mode, a choice point is created like in the WAM. In a local search
space, the search is stopped and a list of search continuations is
returned to the caller. In monadic code, the program is aborted with
an error message. The runtime system uses a set of labels to handle
non-deterministic choices and failures. A pointer to the current set
of handlers, which also includes an entry point to handle deadlocks,
is saved in the [[regs.handlers]] register. When the abstract machine
enters or leaves an encapsulated search, this register is updated
appropriately.

The [[choices]] handler expects a pointer to a null-terminated array
containing all continuation addresses on the top of the stack. The
[[fail]] handler expects an error message string in the first argument
register. \textbf{This must be a C string, not a Curry string.} This
error message is printed when the failure handler is executed in an
I/O context and also during non-deterministic search when the global
flag [[print_fail]] is set.

<<stack.h>>=
struct nondet_handlers {
    Label choices;
    Label deadlock;
    Label fail;
};

@
\subsubsection{Exceptions}
In order to handle I/O exceptions efficiently, the abstract machine
creates an exception frame on the stack when a new exception handler
is installed by the \texttt{catch} function. Each frame saves a
pointer to the current exception handler, which must be a function of
type \texttt{IOError -> IO a}, and the address of the previous
exception frame. The pointer to the current exception frame is saved
in the abstract machine register [[regs.efp]].

In general, only the main thread of a program executes an I/O
computation and therefore there will be only one dedicated exception
handler. However, it is possible to run an I/O computation on any
thread -- even within an encapsulated search -- with the help of
\texttt{unsafePerformIO}. Therefore, each thread uses its own
exception handler chain. The runtime system will initialize the
register [[regs.efp]] with [[0]] when a new thread is created.

<<stack.h>>=
typedef struct exception_frame
{
    Node		   *handler;
    struct exception_frame *frame;
} ExceptionFrame;
